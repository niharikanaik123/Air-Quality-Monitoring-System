# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System

Air pollution, a significant concern in urban areas of developing nations, stems from industrial activities, vehicular emissions, and various human sources. Emissions release harmful gases like CO2, NOx, SO2, PM, VOCs, and other hazardous substances, posing severe threats to human health and ecosystems. The health impacts include respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and allergies, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions. Additionally, air pollution exacerbates climate change, leading to ecological disruptions.
The "Air Quality Monitoring System Using Arduino" addresses the urgent need for effective air quality monitoring and management. Traditional methods, often expensive and limited in scope, fall short. This project offers a cost-effective, accessible solution utilizing Arduino microcontrollers and sensors for real-time detection and monitoring of air pollutants.

## Features
- Real-time Monitoring : Uses Arduino and sensors to detect air pollutants.
- Cost-effective : Provides a low-cost alternative to traditional monitoring systems.
- Accessibility : Empowers individuals, communities, and policymakers with actionable insights.
- Multi-pollutant Detection : Monitors conventional pollutants (CO2, NOx, SO2, PM, VOCs) and hazardous gases (LPG, flammable gases).

## Functionality

1. Detection : Sensors detect various air pollutants in real-time.
2. Monitoring : Data is processed by the Arduino microcontroller.
3. Alerts : System alerts users to the presence of hazardous gases like LPG and flammable gases, helping prevent potential disasters.
